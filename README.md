# Computer Vision: Models Learning and Inference (Algorithms)

Python implementation of the algorithms in the book Computer Vision: Models Learning and Inference by Prof. Simon J.D. Prince. The book is available [here](http://www.computervisionmodels.com) and the algorithms [here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/external/s.prince/book/Algorithms.pdf).

The algorithms are organised according to the chapters in the book which present several topics relating to Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

## Chapter 4
This chapter is a summary of the methods used to fit probability models to data. The chapter covers three methods with each one having two examples: _maximum likelihood estimate_ (4.1, 4.4), _maximum a posteriori_ (4.2, 4.5), and the _Bayesian approach_ (4.3, 4.6).

The first set of examples are for the Univariate Normal Distribution and the latter is for the Categorical Distribution.
